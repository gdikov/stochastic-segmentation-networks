# Stochastic Segmentation Networks
A tutorial reimplementation of [Monteiro et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06015.pdf) on a toy problem. 

## Get started

Open [`stochastic_segmentation_networks.ipynb`](https://github.com/gdikov/stochastic-segmentation-networks/blob/main/stochastic_segmentation_networks.ipynb) and play with the model!

If you are interested in stochastic semantic segmentation you may also want to check out [Kassapis et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13144.pdf) and [this toy reimplementation](https://github.com/gdikov/calibrated-adversarial-learning) of mine.
